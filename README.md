# NamedPipePerm
utilizing Sysinternals' Pipelist and Accesschk to enumerate the current pipes on the machine and list their permissions

right now there is a problem of accessing already maxed out pipes (max number of connections is reached), need to see if the conenctions is just a handle and if it is possible to open a handle to the pipe  and read permissions is possible

for other time
